# swarm-mail

## 1.11.0

### Minor Changes

- [`ff92377`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/ff923778f4ffb2b39ab3165aaf993e9f766b97db) Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - feat: Dex-inspired improvements — result field, status dashboard, doctor, commit linking, tree display

  ### swarm-mail

  - **Schema migration v10**: Added `result` TEXT and `result_at` INTEGER columns to beads table
  - **closeCell result support**: CellClosedEvent now carries optional `result` field, projections write `result`/`result_at` on close
  - **SubtaskOutcomeEvent commit field**: Added optional `commit` object (sha, message, branch) to outcome events
  - **queries-drizzle fix**: Added missing `result`/`result_at` mapping in `findCellsByPartialId`

  ### opencode-swarm-plugin

  - **`hive_close` result param**: Accepts optional `result` string — implementation summary stored on cell completion
  - **`swarm_complete` commit linking**: Auto-captures git SHA, branch, message on task completion; passes summary as `result`
  - **Status dashboard**: `swarm` with no args now shows rich dashboard (progress %, ready/blocked/completed sections, active agents)
  - **Enhanced doctor**: `swarm doctor --deep` runs 6 health checks (DB integrity, orphans, cycles, stale reservations, zombie blocked, ghost workers) with `--fix` auto-repair
  - **Tree display**: Status markers `[x]/[ ]/[~]/[!]`, blocker IDs, priority coloring, epic completion %, ANSI-aware truncation

### Patch Changes

- [`cbdfcdb`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/cbdfcdbc381d607005ad671dde334a5f205dccb6) Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - fix: implement WAL checkpoint to prevent hive cell loss across process restarts

  LibSQLAdapter now implements `checkpoint()` (PRAGMA wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)) so `db.checkpoint?.()` calls are no longer no-ops. Also checkpoints on connection open to recover abandoned WAL frames from prior short-lived processes (e.g., `swarm tool` CLI invocations via clawdbot).

## 1.10.4

### Patch Changes

- fix(store): add defensive null check in ftsSearch for invalid query
  - Returns empty array instead of crashing on undefined/null query
  - Last line of defense for hivemind_find TypeError bug

## 1.10.3

### Patch Changes

- [`8badfe8`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/8badfe8a13324f278b22e35891590f2e84c9cd0e) Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - feat(observability): wire linkOutcomeToTrace for quality_score population

  When workers complete via swarm_complete, the outcome event is now linked
  back to its decision trace, enabling quality_score calculation. This fixes
  the 0% success rate previously shown in `swarm stats` and `swarm o11y`.

  New functions:

  - `findDecisionTraceByBead()` - look up decision traces by bead ID
  - `linkOutcomeToDecisionTrace()` - helper to link outcomes to traces

## 1.10.2

### Patch Changes

- [`95a0d33`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/95a0d33398c5336f52daf107d515c24e3b7f51a9) Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - > "This book is about writing cost-effective, maintainable, and pleasing code." — Sandi Metz & Katrina Owen, _99 Bottles of OOP_

  ## 🧪 Version Alignment Guard

  The swarm-mail release now keeps the `SWARM_MAIL_VERSION` constant aligned with `package.json`, and the tarball packaging test asserts that alignment to catch drift early.

  **What changed**

  - Version constant stays in lockstep with `package.json`
  - Tarball test fails fast if versions diverge

  **Why it matters**

  - Prevents shipping tarballs with stale version metadata
  - Keeps runtime diagnostics consistent with published versions

  **Compatibility**

  - No API changes; internal consistency and tests only

  ## 📦 Tarball Reliability Bump

  We’re bumping `swarm-mail` to ship the tarball integrity checks and avoid stale package metadata.

  **What changed**

  - Tarball packaging checks added to catch version drift early

  **Why it matters**

  - Prevents publishing packages with mismatched metadata

  **Compatibility**

  - No API changes

  ## 🐝 Coordinator Reservation Overrides

  - Add `releaseAllSwarmFiles` + `releaseSwarmFilesForAgent` admin paths for coordinator recovery.
  - Extend `file_released` events with `release_all` and `target_agent` for precise cleanup.
  - Expose `swarmmail_release_all` and `swarmmail_release_agent` in plugin + wrapper template.

  ## 🧹 UBS Reference Cleanup

  - Remove UBS references from prompts, doctor guidance, and docs.
  - Drop UBS availability checks from swarm init/tool availability.

  **Backward compatible:** existing `swarmmail_release` behavior is unchanged for workers.

## 1.9.3

### Patch Changes

- [`42ac262`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/42ac26268d4ac97ce814f7ecf80108efc5d72e73) Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - ## Fix: Remove stale `created_at` column references

  Fixes `SQLITE_ERROR: table events has no column named created_at` that occurred during database migrations.

  **What happened:** The events table schema was updated to remove `created_at`, but migration code and schema checks still referenced it.

  **Fixed locations:**

  - `auto-migrate.ts` - migration column checks
  - `libsql-schema.ts` - required columns validation
  - `streams.ts` - schema definitions

  No data migration needed - the column never existed in production databases.

## 1.9.2

### Patch Changes

- [`6e9538d`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/6e9538d95bebac8817feec6c3d52053fc5e8bd2b) Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - ## Fix: Remove stale `created_at` column references

### Patch Changes

- [`d6ca070`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/d6ca07079420328ee607d769127bcc88e2fdb509) Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - ## 🐝 The Hive Learns From Its Mistakes

  ```
       ___
      /   \    "Pattern failed 4 times..."
     | o o |   "...make that 5."
      \ ~ /    "AVOID: Split by file type"
       |||
      /   \
  ```

  The learning system feedback loop is now fully wired. Patterns that consistently fail get auto-deprecated so future swarms don't repeat the same mistakes.

  **What changed:**

  ### Anti-Pattern Auto-Deprecation (opencode-swarm-plugin)

  - `swarm_complete` now extracts decomposition patterns from epic descriptions
  - Records success/failure observations via `recordPatternObservation()`
  - Patterns exceeding 60% failure rate auto-invert to anti-patterns with "AVOID:" prefix
  - Response includes `pattern_observations` with extracted patterns and any inversions

  ### Migration Fix (swarm-mail)

  - Fixed stale `created_at` column reference in events table migration
  - Resolves: `SQLITE_ERROR: table events has no column named created_at`

  ### CLI Bundling (opencode-swarm-plugin)

  - CLI now bundles `swarm-mail` directly instead of marking it external
  - Prevents version mismatch when globally installed via npm
  - CLI size: 4.71 MB → 13.57 MB (acceptable tradeoff for reliability)

  **Why it matters:**

  - Swarms now learn from failures automatically
  - Bad decomposition strategies get flagged before they waste more time
  - The 60% threshold + 3 observation minimum prevents hasty deprecation

  Agents are ephemeral. Context is not. Session handoff ensures the next agent picks up where you left off.

  **New Tools:**

  - `hive_session_start` - Start session, receive previous handoff notes
  - `hive_session_end` - End session with notes for the next agent

  **New CLI Commands:**

  - `swarm session start` - Start a session
  - `swarm session end` - End with handoff notes
  - `swarm session status` - Check current session
  - `swarm session history` - List recent sessions

  **Schema:** Migration v9 adds `sessions` table with handoff_notes, timestamps, and cell linkage.

  **Usage:**

  ```typescript
  // At session start
  const { previous_handoff } = await hive_session_start({
    active_cell_id: "bd-123",
  });
  // previous_handoff: "Completed auth flow. Next: add tests. Watch out for token refresh race condition."

  // At session end
  await hive_session_end({
    handoff_notes:
      "Added 12 tests. All passing. Next: wire into CI. The mock server needs HTTPS.",
  });
  ```

  ### Session Handoff Notes

  Chainlink-inspired session management with handoff notes for context preservation across sessions.

  **New CLI commands:**

  - `swarm session start` - Start a new session with optional handoff notes
  - `swarm session end` - End session with summary and handoff notes
  - `swarm session status` - Show current session status
  - `swarm session history` - List recent sessions

  **New API:**

  - `SessionAdapter` interface with 5 methods
  - Schema migration v9 adds sessions table

  ### UBS Stub Detection

  15 patterns adapted from Chainlink's `post-edit-check.py` for detecting incomplete code:

  - TODO, FIXME, XXX, HACK comments
  - Empty function bodies (`pass`, `...`)
  - Language-specific stubs (`unimplemented!()`, `todo!()`)
  - Placeholder returns with stub comments

  ### Tree View CLI

  `swarm tree` command with ASCII visualization:

  ```
  Feature Epic [epic] ○ P1
  ├── Subtask 1 [task] ◐ P2
  ├── Subtask 2 [task] ● P2
  └── Subtask 3 [task] ⊘ P2
  ```

  **Status indicators:** ○ open, ◐ in_progress, ● closed, ⊘ blocked

  ### Adversarial Reviewer (Sarcasmotron)

  VDD-style hostile reviewer with zero tolerance for slop:

  - **Fresh context per review** - prevents "relationship drift"
  - **HALLUCINATING verdict** - when adversary invents issues, code is zero-slop
  - **Hostile tone** - no participation trophies

  > "The best way to have a good idea is to have lots of ideas and throw away the bad ones."
  > — Linus Pauling (via pdf-brain on iterative refinement)

  ### Coordinator Violation Prevention (19.6% → target <5%)

  **Prompt Engineering:**

  - Added explicit NEVER/ONLY rules with box-drawing visual prominence
  - Concrete violation examples: `read()`, `edit()`, `bash("test")`, `swarmmail_reserve`
  - Correct delegation examples showing `swarm_spawn_subtask` pattern

  **Runtime Guard (`coordinator-guard.ts`):**

  - `CoordinatorGuardError` thrown when coordinators attempt forbidden operations
  - Detects file edits, test execution, and file reservations
  - Helpful error messages with suggestions for correct approach
  - Workers pass through unimpeded

  **Violation Metrics:**

  - `trackCoordinatorViolation()` records violations to event store
  - `getViolationAnalytics()` aggregates violation rates by type
  - Ready for integration with `swarm health` dashboard

  ### Hivemind Resilience

  **FTS Fallback (fixes Josh Wood's bug report):**

  - `hivemind_find` now gracefully falls back to full-text search when Ollama unavailable
  - Response includes `fallback_used: true` indicator
  - No more "Connection failed" errors when Ollama isn't running

  **Invalid Date Fix:**

  - Fixed null/undefined date handling in `store.ts`
  - `new Date(null)` no longer creates Invalid Date
  - Proper fallback to current timestamp for missing dates

  ### Breaking Changes

  None - all changes are additive or fix existing bugs.

           ╰──────────────────────────────────────────────╯

      🐝 ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 🐝
  ```

  **What changed:**

  `swarm_complete` now accurately reports the reservation release outcome:

  - `reservations_released`: boolean - whether release succeeded
  - `reservations_released_count`: number - how many reservations were released
  - `reservations_release_error`: string | undefined - error message if release failed

  Previously, `reservations_released` was hardcoded to `true` even when the release failed silently.

  **Why it matters:**

  Coordinators and debugging tools can now see the actual state of file reservations after task completion. This helps diagnose coordination issues where files remain locked unexpectedly.

  **Tests added:**

  - Verify reservation release allows other agents to reserve the same files
  - Verify "release all" pattern (no paths specified) works correctly - this is how `swarm_complete` calls `releaseSwarmFiles`

  ### ADR-011: Hivemind Memory Unification

  **15 tools → 8 tools.** Sessions and learnings are now unified under one namespace.

  **What changed:**

  | Old Tool                   | New Tool                            |
  | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
  | `semantic-memory_store`    | `hivemind_store`                    |
  | `semantic-memory_find`     | `hivemind_find`                     |
  | `semantic-memory_get`      | `hivemind_get`                      |
  | `semantic-memory_remove`   | `hivemind_remove`                   |
  | `semantic-memory_validate` | `hivemind_validate`                 |
  | `cass_search`              | `hivemind_find` (collection filter) |
  | `cass_view`                | `hivemind_get`                      |
  | `cass_index`               | `hivemind_index`                    |
  | `cass_stats`               | `hivemind_stats`                    |
  | NEW                        | `hivemind_sync`                     |

  **Why it matters:**

  1. **No more naming collision** - External `semantic-memory` MCP was shadowing our internal tools
  2. **Unified search** - `hivemind_find` searches both learnings AND sessions in one query
  3. **Collection filter** - `collection: "claude"` for Claude sessions, `collection: "default"` for learnings
  4. **Simpler mental model** - Sessions ARE memories, just from a different source

  **Backward compatible:** All old tool names (`semantic-memory_*`, `cass_*`) still work via deprecation aliases. They'll emit warnings but won't break.

  **Migration:** None required. Old tool names continue to work. Update at your leisure.

  **117+ tests** covering all tools, lifecycle, deprecation aliases, and integration points.

  **What changed:**

  Swarm Mail now automatically consolidates project-local databases into a single global database at `~/.config/swarm-tools/swarm.db`. No more scattered data across projects.

  **Why it matters:**

  - **One source of truth** - All coordination data (events, messages, reservations) centralized
  - **Cross-project visibility** - Query patterns across all your projects
  - **Simpler backups** - One database to backup, not N scattered files
  - **Zero user intervention** - Triggers automatically on first access to any project
  - **Idempotent & safe** - Renames old DB to `.migrated` suffix after success, never re-runs

  **How it works:**

  1. On first `getSwarmMailLibSQL()` call, checks for local database
  2. If found, migrates all 16 tables to global DB in background (fire-and-forget)
  3. Renames local DB to `streams.db.migrated` to mark completion
  4. Future calls use global DB directly

  **Migration coverage:**

  Migrates all subsystems:

  - **Streams:** events, agents, messages, message_recipients, reservations, cursors, locks
  - **Hive:** beads, bead_dependencies, bead_labels, bead_comments, blocked_beads_cache, dirty_beads
  - **Learning:** eval_records, swarm_contexts, deferred

  **Manual migration:**

  For power users who want explicit control:

  ```typescript
  import { migrateLocalDbToGlobal } from "swarm-mail";

  const stats = await migrateLocalDbToGlobal(
    "/abs/path/to/.opencode/streams.db",
    "~/.config/swarm-tools/swarm.db"
  );

  console.log(`Migrated ${stats.events} events, ${stats.messages} messages`);
  ```

  **Backward compatible:** Existing code continues to work. Projects without local DBs start fresh with global DB.

  ### What Changed

  **swarm-mail:**

  - `getDatabasePath()` now ALWAYS returns global path (`~/.config/swarm-tools/swarm.db`)
  - Local project databases will be auto-migrated in a future release (placeholder warning added)
  - Auto-tagger LLM tests now opt-in via `RUN_LLM_TESTS=1` (prevents flaky CI)

  **opencode-swarm-plugin:**

  - Fixed type mismatches in compaction hook (HiveAdapter → MinimalHiveAdapter)
  - Fixed eval capture in tool hooks (args not available in after hook)
  - All 425 tests passing

  ### Why Global Database?

  Single source of truth across all projects:

  - No more orphaned databases in worktrees
  - Consistent swarm state regardless of working directory
  - Simpler backup/restore story

  ### ⚠️ Breaking: Local Databases Orphaned

  Existing local databases at `{project}/.opencode/swarm.db` are **NOT migrated**.
  They remain on disk but are no longer read. A warning is logged when detected.

  **Tracked:** Cell `mjrd8cyhvnu` - Implement local-to-global DB migration

  **If you have important data in local DBs**, wait for migration tool or manually copy:

  ```bash
  # Check if you have local data
  ls -la .opencode/swarm.db
  ```

  > "They test implementation detail and hurt migrations."
  > — _The Coding Career Handbook_

  Migrated `smart-operations.eval.ts` from evalite to bun:test integration tests.

  **Why?** The sqlite-vec (vec0) extension loads fine in bun's native test runner but throws `SQLITE_CORRUPT_VTAB` in vitest/evalite. Rather than mock the unmockable, we moved where the tests can breathe.

  **What moved:**

  - `evals/smart-operations.eval.ts` → `swarm-mail/src/memory/__tests__/smart-operations.integration.test.ts`
  - Deleted: `evals/fixtures/smart-operations-fixtures.ts`
  - Deleted: `evals/scorers/smart-operations-scorer.ts`

  **Test results:** 5 pass, 2 skip (UPDATE/DELETE have a separate libSQL corruption bug being tracked)

  **The eval tested:** ADD/UPDATE/DELETE/NOOP smart memory operations with LLM-powered decision making. Now it actually runs.

### Patch Changes

- [`fb4b2d5`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/fb4b2d545943fa6e5a5f5294f2bcd129191b8667) Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - ## 🔍 hive_cells Now Returns All Matches for Partial IDs

  > "Tune and test your metadata by comparing it with the tone, coverage, and trends of your searchers' common queries."
  > — _Search Analytics for Your Site_

  Previously, `hive_cells({ id: "mjonid" })` would throw an "Ambiguous ID" error when multiple cells matched. This was hostile UX for a **query tool** — users expect to see all matches, not be forced to guess more characters.

  ```
       ┌──────────────────────────────────────┐

       └──────────────────────────────────────┘
  ```

  **What changed:**

  - Added `findCellsByPartialId()` — returns `Cell[]` instead of throwing
  - `hive_cells` now uses this for partial ID lookups
  - `resolvePartialId()` still throws for tools that need exactly one cell (hive_update, hive_close, etc.)

  **Why it matters:**

  - Query tools should return results, not errors
  - Partial ID search is now actually useful for exploration
  - Consistent with how `grep` and other search tools behave

  **What's documented:**

  - Basic usage with code examples
  - Smart operations (Mem0 pattern)
  - Knowledge graph queries
  - Temporal validity tracking
  - New schema tables and columns
  - Service exports for advanced use
  - Graceful degradation behavior

  **Also fixed:** Removed stale pgvector references → now correctly states libSQL native vector support via sqlite-vec.

  ### What Changed

  **swarm-mail:**

  - **README overhaul** - Documented Wave 1-3 memory features with code examples
  - **Test fixes** - `test.skip()` → `test.skipIf(!hasWorkingLLM)` for graceful CI/local behavior
  - Replaced outdated `pgvector` references with `libSQL vec extension`

  **opencode-swarm-plugin:**

  - **ADR: Memory System Eval Strategy** - 3-tier approach (heuristics/integration/LLM-as-judge)
  - **smart-operations.eval.ts** - Evalite test suite for ADD/UPDATE/DELETE/NOOP decisions
  - Fixtures covering 8 test scenarios (exact match, refinement, contradiction, new info)
  - LLM-as-judge scorer with graceful degradation

  ### The Philosophy

  > _"As the system processes more memories over time, it develops increasingly
  > sophisticated knowledge structures, discovering higher-order patterns and
  > concepts across multiple memories."_
  > — A-MEM

  The memory system isn't just storage—it's a living knowledge graph that evolves.

  ### Git Worktree Support (#52)

  All worktrees now share the main repository's database. No more isolated state per worktree.

  ```
  BEFORE:                          AFTER:
  main-repo/.opencode/swarm.db     main-repo/.opencode/swarm.db
  worktree-1/.opencode/swarm.db    worktree-1/ ──┐
  worktree-2/.opencode/swarm.db    worktree-2/ ──┼─→ main-repo/.opencode/
                                   worktree-3/ ──┘
  ```

  **How it works:**

  - Detects worktrees by checking if `.git` is a file (not directory)
  - Parses `gitdir:` path to resolve main repo location
  - All DB operations automatically use main repo's `.opencode/`

  ### Graceful Degradation for semantic-memory (#53)

  When Ollama is unavailable, `semantic-memory_find` now falls back to full-text search instead of erroring.

  **Before:** `OllamaError: Connection failed` → tool fails
  **After:** Warning logged → FTS results returned → tool works

  Also added `repairStaleEmbeddings()` to fix the "dimensions are different: 0 != 1024" error when memories were stored without embeddings.

  ### New Skill: gh-issue-triage

  Added `.opencode/skills/gh-issue-triage/` for GitHub issue triage workflow:

  - Extracts contributor profiles including Twitter handles
  - Templates for acknowledgment comments
  - Changeset credit templates with @mentions

  > "Setting up our tests to run synchronously and using mocking libraries will greatly speed up our testing"
  > — ng-book

  Fixed test isolation issues that caused 19 tests to fail when run together but pass in isolation.

  ### The Culprits

  **1. Global fetch pollution** (`ollama.test.ts`)

  ```typescript
  // BEFORE: Replaced global.fetch, never restored it
  global.fetch = mockFetch;

  // AFTER: Save and restore
  const originalFetch = global.fetch;
  afterEach(() => {
    global.fetch = originalFetch;
  });
  ```

  **2. Port conflicts** (`durable-server.test.ts`)

  - Tests used hardcoded ports (4483, 4484, 4485)
  - Parallel test runs fought over the same ports
  - Fixed: Use `port: 0` for OS-assigned ports, made `server.url` a getter

  **3. AI SDK schema incompatibility** (`memory-operations.ts`)

  - `z.discriminatedUnion` creates `oneOf` at top level
  - Anthropic API requires `type: object` at top level
  - Fixed: Flat object schema with optional fields

  ### Test Stats

  ```
  Before: 19 failures when run together
  After:  0 failures, 1406 tests pass
  ```

  ### Files Changed

  - `src/memory/ollama.test.ts` - Restore global.fetch after each test
  - `src/streams/durable-server.ts` - Dynamic port getter
  - `src/streams/durable-server.test.ts` - Use port 0, rewrite for isolation
  - `src/memory/memory-operations.ts` - Flat schema for Anthropic compatibility
  - Renamed `memory-operations.test.ts` → `memory-operations.integration.test.ts`

- [`aa12943`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/aa12943f3edc8d5e23878b22f44073e4c71367c5) Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - ## 🐝 Eval-Driven Development: The System That Scores Itself

  > "What gets measured gets managed." — Peter Drucker
  > "What gets scored gets improved." — The Swarm

  The plugin now evaluates its own output quality through a progressive gate system. Every compaction prompt gets scored, tracked, and learned from. Regressions become impossible to ignore.

  ### The Pipeline

  ```
  CAPTURE → SCORE → STORE → GATE → LEARN → IMPROVE
     ↑                                      ↓
     └──────────────────────────────────────┘
  ```

  ### What's New

  **Event Capture** (5 integration points)

  - `detection_triggered` - When compaction is detected
  - `prompt_generated` - Full LLM prompt captured
  - `context_injected` - Final content before injection
  - All events stored to `~/.config/swarm-tools/sessions/{session_id}.jsonl`

  **5 Compaction Prompt Scorers**

  - `epicIdSpecificity` - Real IDs, not placeholders (20%)
  - `actionability` - Specific tool calls with values (20%)
  - `coordinatorIdentity` - ASCII header + mandates (25%)
  - `forbiddenToolsPresent` - Lists what NOT to do (15%)
  - `postCompactionDiscipline` - First tool is correct (20%)

  **Progressive Gates**
  | Phase | Threshold | Behavior |
  |-------|-----------|----------|
  | Bootstrap | N/A | Always pass, building baseline |
  | Stabilization | 0.6 | Warn but pass |
  | Production | 0.7 | Fail CI on regression |

  **CLI Commands**

  ```bash

- [`e0c422d`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/e0c422de3f5e15c117cc0cc655c0b03242245be4) Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - ## 🔍 Short IDs Finally Work

  Cell ID resolution now matches **any unique substring**, not just the hash segment.

  **Before:** `hive_start(id="mjkmdat26vq")` → ❌ "No cell found"
  **After:** `hive_start(id="mjkmdat26vq")` → ✅ Works!

  **What changed:**

  - `resolvePartialId()` pattern: `%-hash%-%` → `%substring%`
  - Matches project name, hash, OR timestamp+random segments
  - Added 3 new tests for timestamp+random matching

  **Cell ID anatomy:**

  ```
  opencode-swarm-monorepo-lf2p4u-mjkmdat26vq
  │                       │      │
  └── project name ───────┘      │
                          └ hash ┘
                                 └── timestamp+random (NOW MATCHABLE!)
  ```

  Users can now use the short, memorable end portion of cell IDs.

  PGlite support is now deprecated and will be removed in the next major version.

  **What changed:**

  - Added deprecation warnings to all PGlite-related functions
  - `createInMemorySwarmMail()` now uses libSQL by default
  - `getSwarmMailPGlite()` logs deprecation notice on first use

  **Migration path:**

  - New projects: Use `createInMemorySwarmMail()` or `getSwarmMailLibSQL()`
  - Existing PGlite databases: Run `migratePGliteToLibSQL()` to migrate your data
  - The migration utility preserves all events, projections, and metadata

  **Why the change:**
  libSQL (SQLite-compatible) provides better performance, stability, and ecosystem support. PGlite was experimental and is no longer actively maintained.

  **Timeline:**

  - Current (v0.x): PGlite works with deprecation warnings
  - Next major (v1.0): PGlite support removed entirely

  Start migrating now to avoid breaking changes in v1.0.

## 1.5.0

### Minor Changes

- [`a78a40d`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/a78a40de32eb34d1738b208f2a36929a4ab6cb81) Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - ## 📊 Analytics Queries: Four Golden Signals for Swarms

  > "Without data, you're just another person with an opinion." — W. Edwards Deming

  Five pre-built analytics queries based on Google's SRE Four Golden Signals:

  ### The Queries

  1. **Latency** - Task duration by strategy (avg/P95 completion times)
  2. **Traffic** - Events per hour (time-series with bucketing)
  3. **Errors** - Failed tasks by agent (failure tracking)
  4. **Saturation** - Active reservations (resource usage)
  5. **Conflicts** - Most contested files (hotspot detection)

  ### Usage

  ```typescript
  import { runAnalyticsQuery, ANALYTICS_QUERIES } from "swarm-mail";

  // List available queries
  ANALYTICS_QUERIES.forEach((q) => console.log(q.name, q.description));

  // Run a query
  const result = await runAnalyticsQuery(db, "latency", {
    since: new Date(Date.now() - 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000), // last 24h
    format: "table", // or 'json', 'csv'
  });
  ```

  ### Why This Matters

  Event sourcing gives us the data. These queries give us the answers:

  - Which decomposition strategies are fastest?
  - Which agents fail most often?
  - Which files cause the most contention?
  - How busy is the swarm right now?

  All queries use parameterized SQL (security) and support time filtering.

### Patch Changes

- [`5a7c084`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/5a7c084514297b5b9ca5df9459a74f18eb805b8a) Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - ## 🐝 SSE Streams Now Actually Stream

  Fixed a subtle bug where SSE connections would hang indefinitely when requesting live events from the current head offset.

  **The Problem:**
  When a client connects with `?live=true&offset=N` where N equals the current head (meaning "only send me NEW events"), the server had nothing to send immediately. Bun's `fetch()` would block waiting for the first byte, and the connection would timeout.

  **The Fix:**
  Send an SSE comment (`: connected\n\n`) at stream start to flush headers. SSE comments are ignored by clients but establish the connection immediately.

  ```typescript
  // Before: fetch() hangs waiting for first byte
  const stream = new ReadableStream({
    async start(controller) {
      // If no existing events, nothing gets enqueued
      // Client's fetch() blocks forever
    },
  });

  // After: connection established immediately
  const stream = new ReadableStream({
    async start(controller) {
      controller.enqueue(encoder.encode(": connected\n\n"));
      // Client receives headers, can start reading
    },
  });
  ```

  **Bonus fix:** Added `startOffset` parameter to `subscribe()` to eliminate async initialization race condition.

  All 18 durable-server tests now pass (was 17/18).

## 1.4.0

### Minor Changes

- [`652fd16`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/652fd16ff424eff92ebb3f5da0599caf676de2ce) Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - ## 🔭 Observability Stack MVP: See What Your Swarm Is Doing

  > "You can't improve what you can't measure." — Peter Drucker

  The swarm just got eyes. This release adds comprehensive observability for multi-agent coordination, answering the eternal question: "Why did my epic fail?"

  ### What's New

  **Structured Error Classes** (swarm-mail)

  - `BaseSwarmError` with rich context: agent, bead_id, epic_id, timestamp, recent events
  - Specialized errors: `ReservationError`, `CheckpointError`, `ValidationError`, `DecompositionError`
  - Every error includes actionable suggestions for resolution
  - Full `toJSON()` serialization for logging and debugging

  **DEBUG Logging** (swarm-mail)

  - `DEBUG=swarm:*` environment variable filtering
  - 4 subsystems: `swarm:events`, `swarm:reservations`, `swarm:messages`, `swarm:checkpoints`
  - Zero overhead when disabled

  **swarm-db CLI** (swarm-mail)

  ```bash
  # Raw SQL queries (SELECT only, max 1000 rows)
  swarm-db query "SELECT type, COUNT(*) FROM events GROUP BY type"

  # Pre-built analytics
  swarm-db analytics failed-decompositions --since 7d --format json

  # List available analytics
  swarm-db list
  ```

  **10 Pre-built Analytics Queries** (Four Golden Signals mapped)
  | Query | What It Answers |
  |-------|-----------------|
  | `failed-decompositions` | Which strategies are failing? |
  | `strategy-success-rates` | What's working? |
  | `lock-contention` | Where are agents fighting over files? |
  | `agent-activity` | Who's doing what? |
  | `message-latency` | How fast is coordination? |
  | `scope-violations` | Who's touching files they shouldn't? |
  | `task-duration` | How long do tasks take? |
  | `checkpoint-frequency` | Are agents checkpointing enough? |
  | `recovery-success` | Do checkpoints actually help? |
  | `human-feedback` | What are reviewers rejecting? |

  **Agent-Facing Tools** (opencode-swarm-plugin)

  ```typescript
  // Query analytics programmatically
  swarm_analytics({
    query: "failed-decompositions",
    since: "7d",
    format: "summary",
  });

  // Raw SQL for power users (max 50 rows, context-safe)
  swarm_query({ sql: "SELECT * FROM events WHERE type = 'task_blocked'" });

  // Auto-diagnosis for debugging
  swarm_diagnose({
    epic_id: "bd-123",
    include: ["blockers", "errors", "timeline"],
  });

  // Learning insights for feedback loops
  swarm_insights({ scope: "epic", metrics: ["success_rate", "avg_duration"] });
  ```

  ### Why This Matters

  Before: "The swarm failed. No idea why."
  After: "Strategy X failed 80% of the time due to file conflicts. Switching to Y."

  Event sourcing was already 80% of the solution. This release adds the diagnostic views to make that data actionable.

  ### Test Coverage

  - 588 tests passing
  - 1214 assertions
  - Full TDD: every feature started with a failing test

## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [#54](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/pull/54) [`358e18f`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/358e18f0f7f18d03492ef16c2c1d3edd85c00101) Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - ## 🐝 The Great Drizzle Migration

  > _"In most cases, a change to an application's features also requires a change to data that it stores: perhaps a new field or record type needs to be captured, or perhaps existing data needs to be presented in a new way."_
  > — Martin Kleppmann, _Designing Data-Intensive Applications_

  The hive's data layer got a complete overhaul. PGlite is out, libSQL is in, and Drizzle ORM now handles all the heavy lifting.

  ```
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │                  BEFORE → AFTER                     │
  ├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
  │  PGlite (WASM Postgres)  →  libSQL (SQLite fork)   │
  │  Raw SQL strings         →  Drizzle ORM            │
  │  Implicit connections    →  Explicit adapters      │
  │  Test flakiness          →  Deterministic tests    │
  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
  ```

  ### What Changed

  **Database Layer:**

  - Migrated from PGlite to libSQL for all persistence
  - Introduced `DatabaseAdapter` interface for dependency injection
  - All Effect primitives now accept explicit database connections
  - Added `getSwarmMailLibSQL()` factory for clean initialization

  **Effect Primitives Refactored:**

  - `DurableDeferred` - now takes adapter, cleaner resolve/reject
  - `DurableLock` - explicit connection, better timeout handling
  - `DurableCursor` - adapter-based, no global state
  - `DurableMailbox` - consistent with other primitives

  **Test Infrastructure:**

  - 32 failing tests fixed through schema alignment
  - `createInMemorySwarmMail()` for fast, isolated tests
  - No more WASM initialization flakiness
  - Tests run in <100ms instead of 5s+

  **Schema Alignment:**

  - Unified schema between memory and streams
  - Fixed PostgreSQL → SQLite syntax (ANY() → IN())
  - Vector search now uses proper `vector_top_k` with index

  ### Migration Notes

  If you were using internal APIs:

  ```typescript
  // BEFORE (implicit global state)
  import { getDatabase } from "swarm-mail";
  const db = await getDatabase();

  // AFTER (explicit adapter)
  import { getSwarmMailLibSQL } from "swarm-mail";
  const adapter = await getSwarmMailLibSQL({ path: "./data.db" });
  ```

  **PGlite is deprecated.** It remains only for migrating legacy databases. New code should use libSQL exclusively.

  ### Why This Matters

  - **Faster tests** - No WASM cold start, in-memory SQLite is instant
  - **Cleaner architecture** - No hidden global state, explicit dependencies
  - **Better debugging** - Drizzle's query logging beats raw SQL
  - **Future-proof** - libSQL's Turso integration for edge deployment

### Patch Changes

- [#54](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/pull/54) [`358e18f`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/358e18f0f7f18d03492ef16c2c1d3edd85c00101) Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - ## 🧪 Integration Test Coverage: 0% → 95%

  > _"Many characterization tests look like 'sunny day' tests. They don't test many special conditions; they just verify that particular behaviors are present. From their presence, we can infer that refactoring hasn't broken anything."_
  > — Michael Feathers, _Working Effectively with Legacy Code_

  We had a bug that broke ALL swarm tools:

  ```
  Error: [streams/store] dbOverride parameter is required for this function.
  PGlite getDatabase() has been removed.
  ```

  **Why didn't tests catch it?** No integration tests exercised the full tool → store → DB path.

  **Now they do.**

  ```

  │  ✅ semantic_memory_store, semantic_memory_find (2 tests)       │
  │  ✅ Smoke test - 9 tools in sequence (1 test)                   │
  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
  ```

  ### What's Tested

  Each test calls `tool.execute()` and verifies:

  1. No "dbOverride required" error (the bug symptom)
  2. Tool returns expected structure
  3. Full path works: tool → store → DB → response

  ### The Smoke Test

  Runs 9 tools in sequence to catch interaction bugs:

  ```
  swarmmail_init → hive_create → swarmmail_reserve → swarm_progress
  → semantic_memory_store → semantic_memory_find → swarmmail_send
  → hive_close → swarmmail_release
  ```

  If ANY step throws "dbOverride required", the test fails.

  ### Also Fixed

  - **Auto-adapter creation** in store.ts - functions now auto-create adapters when not provided
  - **Exported `clearAdapterCache()`** for test isolation
  - **Migrated test files** from old `getDatabase()` to adapter pattern

  ### Mandatory Coordinator Review Loop

  Added `COORDINATOR_POST_WORKER_CHECKLIST` constant and `post_completion_instructions` field to `swarm_spawn_subtask`. Coordinators now get explicit instructions to review worker output before spawning the next worker.

  The "dbOverride required" bug **cannot recur undetected**.

  ```
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │  BEFORE: URL_INVALID error on bare paths                    │
  │  AFTER:  Automatic normalization to file: URLs              │
  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
  ```

  **The Bug:**

  ```
  Error: URL_INVALID: The URL '/Users/joel/.config/swarm-tools/swarm.db'
  is not in a valid format
  ```

  libSQL's `createClient()` requires URL-formatted paths (`file:/path/to/db.db`),
  but `getDatabasePath()` returns bare filesystem paths (`/path/to/db.db`).

  **The Fix:**
  `createLibSQLAdapter()` now normalizes bare paths automatically:

  ```typescript
  // These all work now:
  createLibSQLAdapter({ url: "/path/to/db.db" }); // → file:/path/to/db.db
  createLibSQLAdapter({ url: "./relative/db.db" }); // → file:./relative/db.db
  createLibSQLAdapter({ url: ":memory:" }); // → :memory: (unchanged)
  createLibSQLAdapter({ url: "file:/path/db.db" }); // → file:/path/db.db (unchanged)
  createLibSQLAdapter({ url: "libsql://host/db" }); // → libsql://host/db (unchanged)
  ```

  **Affected Users:**
  Anyone using `swarmmail_init` or other tools that create file-based databases
  was hitting this error. Now it just works.

  The last vestiges of PGLite runtime code have been swept away. What remains is only the migration machinery—kept for users upgrading from the old world.

  **Removed:**

  - `pglite.ts` - The `wrapPGlite()` shim that nobody was importing
  - `leader-election.ts` - PGLite-specific file locking (libSQL handles this natively)
  - Associated test files

  **Added:**

  - `pglite-remnants.regression.test.ts` - 9 tests ensuring array parameter handling works correctly in libSQL (the `IN()` vs `ANY()` saga)

  **Updated:**

  - JSDoc examples now show libSQL patterns instead of PGLite
  - Migration test inlines the `wrapPGlite` helper it needs

  **What's left of PGLite:**

  - `migrate-pglite-to-libsql.ts` - Dynamic import, only loads when migrating
  - `memory/migrate-legacy.ts` - Same pattern, migration-only
  - Comments explaining the differences (documentation, not code)

## 1.2.2

### Patch Changes

- [`97e89a6`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/97e89a6d944b70f205eeb83eb3f2c55a42f5dc08) Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - ## 🐝 Setup Skips Already-Migrated Memories

  `swarm setup` now detects when semantic memories have already been migrated and skips the migration prompt entirely.

  **Before:** Setup would prompt "Migrate to swarm-mail database?" even when all memories were already migrated, then hang.

  **After:** Setup checks if target database has memories first. If already migrated, shows dim "Already migrated to swarm-mail" and moves on.

  **Changes:**

  - Added `targetHasMemories(targetDb)` function to swarm-mail
  - Updated setup flow to check target before prompting
  - Fixed connection cleanup in all code paths (try/finally pattern)
  - Suppressed internal PGLite NOTICE messages from user output

  **Root cause of hang:** PGLite connection wasn't being closed in all paths, keeping the Node.js event loop alive indefinitely.

  postgres.js requires single-connection mode (`max: 1`) when not using explicit `sql.begin()` transactions. The default of 10 connections caused transaction safety errors and hanging connections during migrations.

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [`70ff3e0`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/70ff3e054cd1991154f7631ce078798de1076ba8) Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - ## 🐝 Daemon Mode Now Self-Heals

  The daemon socket connection was fragile - it would error out instead of recovering from common scenarios like stale PID files or race conditions.

  **Changes:**

  ### 1. New Default Port: 15433

  Moved from 5433 (too close to Postgres default) to 15433. Override with `SWARM_MAIL_SOCKET_PORT`.

  ### 2. Self-Healing Connection Logic

  New flow tries connecting FIRST before starting:

  ```
  1. Health check → if healthy, connect immediately
  2. Check for stale PID → clean up if process dead
  3. Try startDaemon with retry loop
  4. On EADDRINUSE, wait and retry health check (another process may have started it)
  5. Only error after all recovery attempts fail
  ```

  ### 3. Exported `cleanupPidFile`

  Now available for external cleanup scenarios.

  **What this fixes:**

  - "Failed to listen at 127.0.0.1" errors
  - Stale PID files blocking startup
  - Race conditions when multiple processes start simultaneously
  - Daemon crashes requiring manual `pkill` intervention

  **Tests added:** 4 new tests covering self-healing scenarios.

## 1.1.1

### Patch Changes

- [`19995a6`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/19995a68dd1283de1d13afa6fc028bd1273d1b27) Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - ## 🐝 Squashed the BigInt Date Bug

  PGLite returns BIGINT columns as JavaScript `bigint` type. The `Date` constructor throws when given a bigint:

  ```javascript
  new Date(1734628445371n); // TypeError: Cannot convert a BigInt value to a number
  ```

  This caused `Invalid Date` errors in all hive operations (`hive_query`, `hive_create`, etc).

  **Fix:** Wrap timestamps in `Number()` before passing to `Date`:

  ```typescript
  // Before (broken)
  new Date(cell.created_at);

  // After (works with both number and bigint)
  new Date(Number(cell.created_at));
  ```

  **Files fixed:**

  - `swarm-mail/src/hive/jsonl.ts` - JSONL export functions
  - `opencode-swarm-plugin/src/hive.ts` - `formatCellForOutput()`

  **Tests added:** 6 new tests covering bigint date handling edge cases.

  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
  ```

  Cell IDs got long. Now you can use just the hash portion.

  **What changed:**

  ### swarm-mail

  - Added `resolvePartialId(adapter, partialId)` to resolve partial hashes to full cell IDs
  - Supports exact match, prefix match, suffix match, and substring match
  - Returns helpful error messages for ambiguous matches ("Found 3 cells matching 'abc': ...")
  - 36 new tests covering all resolution scenarios

  ### opencode-swarm-plugin

  - `hive_update`, `hive_close`, `hive_start` now accept partial IDs
  - Resolution happens transparently - full ID returned in response
  - Backward compatible - full IDs still work

  **JSONL Fix (bonus):**

  - `serializeToJSONL()` now adds trailing newline for POSIX compliance
  - Prevents parse errors when appending to existing files

  **Why it matters:**

  - Less typing, fewer copy-paste errors
  - Matches git's partial SHA workflow (muscle memory)
  - Ambiguous matches fail fast with actionable error messages

  ## Auto-Sync at Key Events

  ```
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │  hive_create_epic  →  auto-sync         │
  │  swarm_complete    →  auto-sync         │
  │  process.exit      →  safety net sync   │
  └─────────────────────────────────────────┘
  ```

  Cells no longer get lost when processes exit unexpectedly.

  **What changed:**

  - `hive_create_epic` syncs after creating epic + subtasks (workers can see them immediately)
  - `swarm_complete` syncs before worker exits (completed work persists)
  - `process.on('beforeExit')` hook catches any remaining dirty cells

  **Why it matters:**

  - Spawned workers couldn't see cells created by coordinator (race condition)
  - Worker crashes could lose completed work
  - Now the lazy-write pattern has strategic checkpoints

  ***

  ## Removed Arbitrary Subtask Limits

  ```
  BEFORE: max_subtasks capped at 10 (why tho?)
  AFTER:  no limit - LLM decides based on task complexity
  ```

  **What changed:**

  - Removed `.max(10)` from `swarm_decompose` and `swarm_plan_prompt`
  - `max_subtasks` is now optional with no default
  - Prompt says "as many as needed" instead of "2-10"

  **Why it matters:**

  - Complex epics need more than 10 subtasks
  - Arbitrary limits force awkward decomposition
  - Trust the coordinator to make good decisions

  **Daemon mode is the default.** When you call `getSwarmMail()`, we:

  1. Start an in-process `PGLiteSocketServer` (no external binary!)
  2. All connections go through this server
  3. Multiple processes? No problem. They all talk to the same daemon.

  ```typescript
  // Before: Each process creates its own PGlite → 💥 corruption
  const swarmMail = await getSwarmMail("/project");

  // After: First process starts daemon, others connect → ✅ safe
  const swarmMail = await getSwarmMail("/project");
  ```

  ### Opt-Out (if you must)

  ```bash
  # Single-process mode (embedded PGlite)
  SWARM_MAIL_SOCKET=false
  ```

  ⚠️ Only use embedded mode when you're **certain** only one process accesses the database.

  ### Bonus: 9x Faster Tests

  We added a shared test server pattern. Instead of creating a new PGlite instance per test (~500ms WASM startup), tests share one instance and TRUNCATE between runs.

  | Metric           | Before | After |
  | ---------------- | ------ | ----- |
  | adapter.test.ts  | 8.63s  | 0.96s |
  | Per-test average | 345ms  | 38ms  |

  ### Breaking Change

  If you were relying on embedded mode being the default, set `SWARM_MAIL_SOCKET=false`.

  ### The Architecture

  ```

  │  Process 1      Process 2      ...      │

  │   └───────────────────┘                 │
  └─────────────────────────────────────────┘
  ```

  No external binaries. No global installs. Just safety.

### Minor Changes

- [`181fdd5`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/181fdd507b957ceb95e069ae71d527d3f7e1b940) Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - ## 🛡️ WAL Safety: The Checkpoint That Saved the Hive

  PGlite's Write-Ahead Log nearly ate our lunch. 930 WAL files. 930MB of uncommitted transactions.
  One WASM OOM crash later, pdf-brain lost 359 documents.

  **Never again.**

  ### What Changed

  **New DatabaseAdapter methods:**

  ```typescript
  // Force WAL flush to data files
  await db.checkpoint();

  // Monitor WAL health (default 100MB threshold)
  const { healthy, message } = await db.checkWalHealth(100);

  // Get raw stats
  const { walSize, walFileCount } = await db.getWalStats();
  ```

  **Automatic checkpoints after:**

  - Hive migrations complete
  - Streams migrations complete
  - Any batch operation that touches multiple records

  **Health check integration:**

  ```typescript
  const health = await swarmMail.healthCheck();
  // { connected: true, walHealth: { healthy: true, message: "WAL healthy: 2.5MB (3 files)" } }
  ```

  ### Why It Matters

  PGlite in embedded mode accumulates WAL files without explicit CHECKPOINT calls. Each unclean shutdown compounds the problem. Eventually: OOM.

  The fix is simple but critical:

  1. **Checkpoint after batch ops** - forces WAL to data files, allows recycling
  2. **Monitor WAL size** - warn at 100MB, not 930MB
  3. **Prefer daemon mode** - single long-lived process handles its own WAL

  ### Deployment Recommendation

  **Use daemon mode in production.** Multiple short-lived PGlite instances compound WAL accumulation. A single daemon process:

  - Owns the database connection
  - Checkpoints naturally during operation
  - Cleans up properly on shutdown

  See README.md "Deployment Modes" section for details.

  ### The Lesson

  > "The database doesn't forget. It just waits."

  WAL is a feature, not a bug. But like any feature, it needs care and feeding.
  Now swarm-mail feeds it automatically.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- [`1e41c9b`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/1e41c9b42ae468761f813d406171d182fb9948e0) Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - ## 🐝 Semantic Memory Consolidation

  > _"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."_
  > — Leonardo da Vinci

  The semantic memory system has moved into swarm-mail, bringing persistent learning to the hive.

  ### What's New

  **Semantic Memory in swarm-mail:**

  - `createSemanticMemory()` - Initialize memory store with PGLite + Ollama embeddings
  - `getMigrationStatus()` - Check if legacy memory needs migration
  - `migrateLegacyMemory()` - Migrate from old semantic-memory-mcp format
  - Automatic migration on first use (no manual intervention needed)

  **Legacy Migration:**

  - Detects old `~/.semantic-memory/` databases
  - Migrates memories, embeddings, and metadata
  - Preserves all tags and timestamps
  - Creates backup before migration

  **Worker Handoff Protocol:**

  - Agents can now hand off work mid-task
  - State preserved via swarm mail messages
  - Enables long-running tasks across context limits

  ### Breaking Changes

  None - this is additive. The old semantic-memory-mcp still works but is deprecated.

  ### Files Added/Changed

  - `packages/swarm-mail/src/memory/` - New memory subsystem
  - `packages/swarm-mail/src/memory/migrate-legacy.ts` - Migration tooling
  - `packages/opencode-swarm-plugin/bin/swarm.ts` - Uses new exports

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- [`a2ff1f4`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/a2ff1f4257a2e9857f63abe4e9b941a573f44380) Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - ## 🐝 Cell IDs Now Wear Their Project Colors

  > _"We may fantasize about being International Men of Mystery, but our code needs to be mundane and clear. One of the most important parts of clear code is good names."_
  > — Martin Fowler, _Refactoring_

  Cell IDs finally know where they came from. Instead of anonymous `bd-xxx` prefixes,
  new cells proudly display their project name: `swarm-mail-lf2p4u-abc123`.

  ### What Changed

  **swarm-mail:**

  - `generateBeadId()` now reads `package.json` name field from project directory
  - Added `slugifyProjectName()` for safe ID generation (lowercase, special chars → dashes)
  - Falls back to `cell-` prefix if no package.json or no name field

  **opencode-swarm-plugin:**

  - Removed all `bd` CLI usage from `swarm-orchestrate.ts` - now uses HiveAdapter
  - Improved compaction hook swarm detection with confidence levels (high/medium/low)
  - Added fallback detection prompt for uncertain swarm states

  ### Examples

  | Before                  | After                           |
  | ----------------------- | ------------------------------- |
  | `bd-lf2p4u-mjbneh7mqah` | `swarm-mail-lf2p4u-mjbneh7mqah` |
  | `bd-abc123-xyz`         | `my-cool-app-abc123-xyz`        |
  | (no package.json)       | `cell-abc123-xyz`               |

  ### Why It Matters

  - **Identifiable at a glance** - Know which project a cell belongs to without looking it up
  - **Multi-project workspaces** - Filter/search cells by project prefix
  - **Terminology cleanup** - Removes legacy "bead" (`bd-`) from user-facing IDs

  ### Backward Compatible

  Existing `bd-*` IDs still work fine. No migration needed - only NEW cells get project prefixes.

  ### Compaction: Keeping the Swarm Alive

  > _"Intelligent and structured group dynamics that emerge not from a leader, but from the local interactions of the elements themselves."_
  > — Daniel Shiffman, _The Nature of Code_

  The compaction hook now uses multi-signal detection to keep swarms cooking through context compression:

  - **HIGH confidence:** Active reservations, in_progress cells → full swarm context
  - **MEDIUM confidence:** Open subtasks, unclosed epics → full swarm context
  - **LOW confidence:** Any cells exist → fallback detection prompt

  Philosophy: Err on the side of continuation. A false positive costs context space. A false negative loses the swarm.

- [`50a2bf5`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/50a2bf51c5320c038f202191d7acbfd2179f2cb3) Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - Fix cells view migration not being applied

  The v7 migration (cellsViewMigration) that creates the `cells` view was added after
  swarm-mail@0.3.0 was published. This caused `hive_sync` to fail with
  "relation cells does not exist" because the JSONL export queries the `cells` view.

  This patch ensures the v7 migration is included in the published package.

  **Socket Server Adapter:**

  - New `createSocketAdapter()` wrapping postgres.js for DatabaseAdapter interface
  - Daemon lifecycle: `startDaemon()`, `stopDaemon()`, `isDaemonRunning()`, `healthCheck()`
  - Auto-start daemon on first use with `SWARM_MAIL_SOCKET=true` env var
  - Graceful fallback to embedded PGLite on failure
  - CLI: `swarm-mail-daemon start|stop|status`

  **$TMPDIR Storage (BREAKING):**

  - Streams now stored in `$TMPDIR/opencode-<project-name>-<hash>/streams`
  - Eliminates git pollution from `.opencode/streams/`
  - Auto-cleaned on reboot (ephemeral coordination state)
  - New exports: `getProjectTempDirName()`, `hashProjectPath()`

  This fixes the multi-agent PGLite corruption issue by having all agents connect to a single pglite-server daemon via PostgreSQL wire protocol.

  PGLite requires its WASM data file (pglite.data) at runtime. When bundled into swarm-mail, the path resolution broke because it looked for the file relative to the bundle location instead of the installed @electric-sql/pglite package location.

  This caused "ENOENT: no such file or directory" errors when initializing the database.
